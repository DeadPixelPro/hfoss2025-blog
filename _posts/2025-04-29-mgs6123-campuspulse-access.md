For my contribution, I decided to update the content of the CampusPulse Access 'About' page. 

## What is CampusPulse access?
CampusPulse access is a project with the goals of making it easier to report problems with accessability-related "access points" around campus (notably elveators, wheelchair lifts, automatic doors, etc.), avoid broken access points, and keep up-to-date with the status of access points. Of course, if you want to learn more, I'd reccomend checking out the [About page](https://access.campuspulse.app/about) itself. The actual site itself was forked from the [TunnelVision](https://github.com/wilsonmcdade/tunnelvision) site.

## How did I get involved?
Well, my original plan was to work on an open-source CSH project (Devcade). Specifically, the plan was to work on the onboard. However, we ultimately decided to redo the whole thing, which couldn't have had substantial progress done before the deadline. So, instead, I simply asked Adrian Edwards if there was an open source project on campus that I had enough skill to contribute to. Thus, I was added to the CampusPulse Discord. From then, I was informed about the out-of-date 'About' page. It was still identical to the [TunnelVision About Page](https://tunnelvision.csh.rit.edu/about).

## Actually working on the page
I came into the project knowing HTML and CSS. Most of the content was already written in a Google Doc, so it mostly just needed minor edits to fit it onto the page. Something I didn't know before working on this was Bootstrap. While I'd heard of it before, I didn't know how to use it, much less what it actually was. After some work and two group meetings, the page was completed. 

## Pull requests
The first pull request was just a simple edit to remove a reference to the TunnelVision murals: https://github.com/CampusPulse/access-directory/pull/4
The second pull request (which is what this blog is primarily about) is here: https://github.com/CampusPulse/access-directory/pull/6
The last pull request was made a few weeks later, which just added some links to the page: https://github.com/CampusPulse/access-directory/pull/7
