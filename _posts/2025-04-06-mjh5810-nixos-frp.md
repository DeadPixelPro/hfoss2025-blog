title: "Improving Documentation in NixOS Modules"

----

For [my contribution](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/396657), I wanted to fix some documentation and examples for the Nixos module providing [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) (fast reverse proxy).

### Why I picked it
I use the [NixOS linux distribution](https://nixos.org/) as my daily driver, as well as on my home server setup as well. I had drafted a few things before such as packages, but never opened a pull request as someone else usually ended up getting to it first, and better than I could. I wanted to get some general experience with the project as well in case I ever do want to maintain a package, and improving documentation seemed like a good place to start.

### What was the experience like?
The experience was pretty smooth, as it is a *very* large project there are extensive resources available for contributing to all the different sections, from documentation to packages to systems. People are friendly and understanding, and willing to help.

### The Issue
While trying to figure out a networking solution, I came across [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp), which fit my use case pretty well. It had a module in NixOS already so I figured I would just use that for convenience as that's what my server ran, but doing the configuration took a little longer than I expected. The NixOS module defines it's settings through a Nix object, but frp only accepts TOML, and therefore the examples are in TOML. I had to do some investigating into how it converts it and the syntax, because it is not immediately obvious how to format it. While not hugely complex, I figured I might as well fix it in case anyone else wanted to use it in the future, and streamline the process.
