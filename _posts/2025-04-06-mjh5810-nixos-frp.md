title: "Improving Documentation in NixOS Modules"

---

For [my contribution](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/396657), I wanted to fix some documentation and examples for the Nixos module providing [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) (fast reverse proxy).

### Why I picked it
I use the [NixOS linux distribution](https://nixos.org/) as my daily driver, as well as on my home server setup as well. It's a linux distribution based around the Nix language and it's package manager, which is centered on deterministic builds and configurations. I had drafted a few things to contribute before such as packages, but never opened a pull request as someone else usually ended up getting to it first, and better than I could. I wanted to get some general experience with the project as well in case I ever do want to maintain a package, and improving documentation seemed like a good place to start.

### What was the experience like?
The experience was pretty smooth, as it is a *very* large project there are [extensive resources available for contributing](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to all the different sections, from documentation to packages to systems. People are friendly and understanding, and willing to help. It helped that I had a straightforward contribution that didn't change anything functional, so there was no real need for build tests.

### The Issue
While trying to figure out a networking solution, I came across [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp), which fit my use case pretty well. It had a module in NixOS already so I figured I would just use that for convenience as that's what my server ran, but doing the configuration took a little longer than I expected. The NixOS module defines it's settings through a Nix object, but frp only accepts TOML, and therefore the examples are in TOML. I had to do some investigating into how it converts it and the syntax, because it is not immediately obvious how to format it. While not hugely complex, I figured I might as well fix it in case anyone else wanted to use it in the future, and streamline the process.

### Conclusion
Nixpkgs is a very interesting project to contribute to, as it is both a package manager and a system/distribution in itself. I will likely contribute again, probably even to the frp module, as I would like it to be able to use environment variables and files.
