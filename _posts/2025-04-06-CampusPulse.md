## Why did I pick it?

I wanted to contribute to a RIT student project as a way of supporting the RIT FOSS community. I also figured it would be easier to get ahold of project devs and get assistance with the contribution process if they were fellow RIT students and not internet strangers. I was browsing the list of suggested RIT projects and TA Adrian suggested the CampusPulse project, as he is a lead on the project. I am passionate about accessibility and I wanted to help out, so I chose this project for my first contribution.

## Getting involved

The experience of getting involved was super seamless. I joined the discord group and the team was warm and welcoming. They immediately connected me to all the needed documentation and helped me find tasks to do that were content oriented.
