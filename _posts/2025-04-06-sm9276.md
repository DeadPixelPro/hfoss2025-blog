## Introduction to the Community

For my first open-source contribution, I chose to work with the [Profanity](https://github.com/profanity-im/profanity) project, which is a lightweight,
terminal-based XMPP client written in C. 

I chose Profanity because I found the project approachable. I initially struggled with picking a project, 
as many of them seemed very overwhelming with the code bases. 
I decided to do documentation because I had alot of trouble looking for a project to contribute to, I was too itimdated by the code most of the time. I realized that most of the
projects I could just try to understand and document the code which will make easier for myself and others to try and contribute to projects.

## Why I Picked It

The reason I picked Profanity is because I am super intrested in XMPP as a protocal, it seems so awesome and secure. I wanted to work
on a project that i would use, so I set up a xmpp account so I can use it with this client. I saw that the program was written in C which
is a language I am comfterable in.

## Onboarding Resources

Some of the resources that I found are the following: 
- `README.md`: Helped me set up the project and understand its purpose.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Provided instructions on how to submit issues and pull requests.

These resources made it easier for me to understand how to best contribute.

## The Issue

I decided to take on the task of improving documentation of the Profanity codebase, starting with the file `src\ and src\xmpp`.

## Process
1. I forked the repository and built the project locally to ensure I could test any changes I made.
2. I read through the code in `src\` and wrote structured comments for each function.
3. I used Git to commit my changes and created a pull request on GitHub.
4. I created a pull request.

## Challenges

The main challenge I faced was fully understanding what each function was doing, I used generative AI to help me.
